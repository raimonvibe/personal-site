## 🏥 ECG Monitoring in Medical Devices: Best Libraries for Every Use Case

Ever wondered how hospital devices render heartbeats in real time? Here's a quick guide to the best libraries for ECG signal processing!

| Use Case | Best Library | 🔎 Why? |
|----------|------------|-------|
| 📡 **Real-time ECG rendering** | Qt (C++), OpenGL | Low-latency, optimized for medical displays |
| 📊 **Signal processing (Noise removal)** | SciPy, NumPy (Python) | Filters noise, smooths ECG data |
| 🤖 **Machine learning for heart diseases** | TensorFlow (Python), MATLAB | AI-based arrhythmia detection |
| 🌍 **Web-based ECG streaming** | D3.js, Chart.js (JavaScript) | Used for IoT remote monitoring |
| 🖥 **Windows-based hospital UI** | WPF (C#) | Integrated into hospital software |
